# Visuals
A collection of graphics and schematics for exoplanet astronomy.

This is a collection of codes that create visuals for presentations and/or papers; or graphical images intended for repeat use. 
All images are made by me from scratch, or made by me using publicly available base products as starting points.

I use the Issues to keep track of new image requests.
